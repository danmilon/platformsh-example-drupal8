Killer Drupal 8 Workflow for Platform.sh
========================================

This project is meant to be forked and used as an easy-to-get-going start state for an awesome dev workflow that includes:

1. Canonical upstream repo on [GitHub](http://github.com)
2. Local development and tooling with [Lando](http://docs.devwithlando.io)
3. Hosting on [Platform.sh](http://platform.sh)
4. Automatic manual QA environments for [pull requests](https://docs.platform.sh/administration/integrations/github.html)
6. Merge-to-master deploy-to-platform.sh [deploy pipeline](https://docs.platform.sh/administration/integrations/github.html)
7. Automated code linting, unit testing and behat testing with [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/)

What You'll Need

Before you kick off you'll need to make sure you have a few things:

1. A GitHub account
2. A Platform.sh account
3. A Travis CI account
4. [Lando installed](https://docs.devwithlando.io/installation/installing.html)

It is also definitely worth reading about the upstream [starter kit](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-example-drupal8) and accompanying [documentation](https://docs.platform.sh/gettingstarted/local/lando.html) on using Lando with [Platform.sh](http://platform.sh).
