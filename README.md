Killer Drupal 8 Workflow for Platform.sh
========================================

This project is meant to be forked and used as an easy-to-get-going start state for an awesome dev workflow that includes:

1. Canonical upstream repo on [GitHub](http://github.com)
2. Local development and tooling with [Lando](http://docs.devwithlando.io)
3. Hosting on [Platform.sh](http://platform.sh)
4. Automatic manual QA environments for [pull requests](https://docs.platform.sh/administration/integrations/github.html)
6. Merge-to-master deploy-to-platform.sh [pipeline](https://docs.platform.sh/administration/integrations/github.html)
7. Automated code linting, unit testing and behat testing with [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/)

What You'll Need
----------------

Before you kick off you'll need to make sure you have a few things:

1. A GitHub account, ideally with your SSH key(s) added
2. A Platform.sh account with your SSH key(s) added
3. A Travis CI account
4. [Lando installed](https://docs.devwithlando.io/installation/installing.html)
5. [Git installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)*
6. (Optional) [ZenHub](https://www.zenhub.com/) for Kanban style issue management in GitHub

It is also definitely worth reading about the upstream [starter kit](https://github.com/platformsh/platformsh-example-drupal8) and accompanying [documentation](https://docs.platform.sh/gettingstarted/local/lando.html) on using Lando with [Platform.sh](http://platform.sh).

* If you are using lando you can forgo the git installation (this is potentially useful for Windows devs) by uncommenting git in the tooling section of your .lando.yml. If you do this you'll need to run `lando git` instead of `git` for all the examples below.

Getting Started
---------------

### 1. Setup GitHub

Visit [this start state](https://github.com/thinktandem/platformsh-example-drupal8) on GitHub and fork the project to the org or account of your choosing. Then `git clone` the repo and `cd` into it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thinktandem/platformsh-example-drupal8.git mysite
cd mysite
```

Keep this terminal window active because you are going to need to need it for subsequent steps.

### 2. Setup Platform.sh

Login to Platform.sh and create a new project through the Platform.sh user interface. After naming your site select *"Import your existing code"*. Then follow the instructions on the next slide to import your forked repository. It should be something like this:

```bash
# Add platform's git repo as a remote
git remote add platform PLATFORMID@git.us.platform.sh:PLATFORMID.git

# Push your GitHub repo to platform
git push -u platform master

# Optionally remove the platform remote so you do not accidentally deploy from local to production!
git remote remove platform
```

Optionally you might want to visit your built site on Platform.sh at this point to go through the Drupal installation process and get your DB dialed in.

### 3. Setup Local Lando and Connect Platform.sh with GitHub

#### Lando

Let's start by spinning up a local copy of our Platform.sh site with Lando.

This should spin up the services to run your app (eg `php`, `nginx`, `mariabdb`) and the tools you need to start development (eg `platform cli`, `drush`, `composer`, `drupal console`). This will install a bunch of deps the first time you run it but when it is done you should end up with some URLs you can use to visit your local site.

```bash
cd /path/to/my/repo
lando start
```

If you are interested in tweaking your setup check out the comments in your app's `.lando.yml`. Or you can augment your Lando spin up with additional services or tools by checking out the [advanced Lando docs](https://docs.devwithlando.io/tutorials/setup-additional-services.html).

#### Login to Platform

Now that you've got your Platform.sh site rolling locally with Lando let's login to Platform.sh using the `platform cli` that Lando installed for you.

```bash
# THis should prompt you for a username and password
lando platform

# Verify the login
lando platform auth:info

# Get the ID for your site
# Copy this somewhere for now so you can use it when you comment
# Replace "Workflow Demo" with what you named your site in Step 2.
# Your site ID will be the string between the first set of pipes
lando platform projects | grep "Workflow Demo"
```

#### Connect to GitHub

Use the Platform.sh `PROJECT_ID` you grabbed in the step above and go through the setup [documented here](https://docs.platform.sh/administration/integrations/github.html).

```bash
lando platform integration:add \
  --type=github \
  --project=PROJECT_ID \
  --token=GITHUB-USER-TOKEN \
  --repository=USER/REPOSITORY \
  --build-pull-requests=true \
  --fetch-branches=true
```

Once you paste the `webhook url` into GitHub your Platform.sh instance will track agsinst your GitHub repo.

**THIS MEANS THAT YOUR MASTER BRANCH IS NOW DEPLOYABLE!!!**.

As a result it is an **EXTREMELY GOOD IDEA** to [enable branch protection](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-protected-branches/) for your `master` branch so that people cannot merge to it directly unless appropriate status checks have passed.

#### Optionally Pull DB to Local

You can also import your Platform.sh DB locally.

```bash
# Use the platform.sh CLI to export your database
cd /path/to/repo/root
lando platform db:dump --gzip --file=dump.sql.gz --project=PROJECT_ID --environment=master

# Import the DB with Lando
lando db-import dump.sql.gz

# Remove the DB dump to be safe
rm -f dump.sql.gz
```

If you refresh your local site you should now see what you see on your Platform.sh instance.

### 4. Setup Travis CI

You will want to start by doing Steps 1 and 2 in the Travis [getting started docs](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/). We already have a pre-baked `.travis.yml` file for you so you don't need to worry about that unless you want to tweak it.

Then you will want to visit your Platform.sh account settings page and generate an API Token. **Make sure you copy the token for the next step because you will only see it once!**

Finally, set the following environment variable [via the Travis UI](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/environment-variables/#Defining-Variables-in-Repository-Settings).

```
PLATFORMSH_CLI_TOKEN=TOKEN_YOU_GENERATED
PLATFORMSH_PROJECT_ID=PROJECT_ID (the same id you used for previous steps)
```

Trying Things Out
-----------------

Let's go through a [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) example!

This is a trivial example which deploys all merges into the `master` branch to the production environment. You can configure more complicated workflows (eg a `dev` and/or `test` environment) when you spin up your Platform.sh site but we think this configuration helps maximize continuous delivery.

### 1. Set up a topic branch

```bash
# Go into the repo
cd /path/to/my/github/repo

# Checkout master and get the latest and greatest
git checkout master
git pull origin master

# Spin up a well named topic branch eg ISSUE_NUMBER-DESCRIPTION
git checkout -b 1-fixes-that-thing
```

### 2. Do the dev, commit and push the codes

```
# Do some awesome dev

# Git commit with a message that matches the issue number
git add -A
git commit -m "#1: Describes what i did"

# Push the branch to GitHub
git push origin 1-fixes-that-thing
```

* Check out the Lando Reference section below for some tips on how to run tests before you push. This can save a lot of time and reduce the potential shame you feel for failing the automated QA

### 3. Open a PR and do manual and automated testing

Begin by [opening a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/). This will trigger the spin up of a QA environment for manual testing and a Travis build for automated testing.

Here is an example PR with:

* [PR on GitHub](https://github.com/thinktandem/platformsh-example-drupal8/pull/2)
* [QA Environment on Platform.sh](http://pr-2-tcs3n7y-2a6htdqmmpchu.us.platform.sh/)
* [Travis PR Build](https://travis-ci.org/thinktandem/platformsh-example-drupal8/builds/289355899?utm_source=github_status&utm_medium=notification)

### 4. Deploy

When you are statisifed with the above, and any additional QA steps like manual code review you can [merge the pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/merging-a-pull-request/). This will deploy the feature to production.

Lando Reference
---------------

You should definitely check out the [Lando docs](https://docs.devwithlando.io) for a full sweep on its capabilities but here are some helpers for this particular config. **YOU PROBABLY WANT TO LANDO START YOUR APP BEFORE YOU DO MOST OF THESE THINGS.**

Unless otherwise indicated these should all be run from your repo root (eg the directory that contains the `.lando.yml` for your site).

# Other helpful things
# Rebuild all containers and build process steps
lando rebuild
# Destroy the containers and tools for this app
